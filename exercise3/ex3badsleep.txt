The fourth parameter I decided to use was bad sleep. I used numpy
to generate a floating point number between 0 and 1. If the student
slept badly, i.e. probability generated was less than a certain
threshold the score would decrease by a certain factor (by
multiplying by 0.9) and if the student slept badly the score would
decrease even more. This was applied to both exam score and exercise 
score.
