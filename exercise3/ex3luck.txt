The parameter luck involved randomly generating an integer of 1 or 0.
Two numbers are then generated (using my own weighted random number script
rather than Python's random number module so the final grade isn't so skewed)
The two numbers are then assigned to variables minres and maxres depending on
whether they're minimum or maximum. If luck=0 the minres variable is chosen as
the variable to be used and if luck=1 (luck exists) the maxres variable is chosen.
This function was applied for all the exercises as well as the exam.

The scatterplot shown and saved to your computer shows average weighted luck 
vs. score grouped by letter grade. Average weighted luck was calculated similar
to exam grade.

The KDE and histogram show the *PRESENCE* vs absence of luck. 1=luck variable in
operation, 2=luck variable not in operation
