The effort parameter was set as a variable. A number between 10 and 15 was
generated, again using the weighted random number generator script I wrote, 
and that number was divided by 10 to get a floating point number. This 
number was then used to multiply the exam score and each individual exercise
score, in effect increasing the minimum exam score and the probability
of succeeding in each exercise.

The scatterplot shown and saved to your computer shows effort vs. score grouped 
by letter grade.
